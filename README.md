# FizzBuzz Scichart

This README provides a step-by-step guide to install and run a React application using Vite

Demo: https://fizz-buzz-scichart.vercel.app/

## Prerequisites:
Node.js and npm installed on your system

## Cloning the FizzBuzz SciChart Repository
You can clone the repository using either HTTPS or SSH methods:

Using HTTPS (Recommended for beginners)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chule/fizzBuzzScichart.git
cd fizzBuzzScichart
```
Using SSH (If you have SSH keys configured with GitHub)
```bash
git clone git@github.com:chule/fizzBuzzScichart.git
cd fizzBuzzScichart
```
After cloning, you'll have a local copy of the repository on your machine with all files, branches, and commit history.

## Setting Up After Cloning
Once you've cloned the repository, you'll need to install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
yarn
```
```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
The application should now be running at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is already in use).
